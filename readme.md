# “Personal Space”

Dave and Fania Everitt, with Alice Tuppen-Corps

This [online artwork](https://daveeveritt.github.io/personal-space/) extracts amd refreshes phrases from hundreds of individual diary entries, finding words that match the intensity of live space weather data, measured from 0-9.

## The Diary Texts

For the initial stages of Alice’s TETTT project, 22 daily “prompts” in the form of keywords and phrases encouraged participants to write regular accounts of their life experience. The text on the screen is continually refreshed from **over 500** of these intimate accounts and recollections.

## The Space Weather

The central live “space weather” panel shows the intensity of geomagnetic activity affecting Earth’s magnetic field: the Kp index. This measure of intensity is used in real time to filter and refresh which texts are selected, and to update the image of the Sun.

<!--
The central panel shows two measures of live “space weather”:
extent of the solar wind: in AU (1 Astronomical Unit = distance of Earth from Sun)
-->

## The Nine Panels

These are refreshed according to the numerical order of the Chinese mathematical “magic square” of three, known as the Lo-Shu, historically used to lend order to cultural activities.

This connects the impersonality of space weather with the very personal narratives. The central panel—usually allocated to the element “Earth” in the Lo-Shu—displays live space weather, the colour of the rotating sun reflects its current intensity.

## TO DO

- [ ] Check the JS comment above `getSpaceData()` for simplest approach
- [ ] Investigate [different data](https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-wind/plasma-1-day.json) for density, [speed](https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/summary/solar-wind-speed.json), temperature
